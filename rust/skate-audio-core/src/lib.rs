//! Skate 3 audio graph, ported from the shadow-verified native C++.
//!
//! Source: `skate3recomp-dev/src/skate3_audio_native.cpp`, each function of which was
//! checked against the original recompiled body under the shadow harness before being
//! translated here. Offsets come from `docs/rw_audio_structs.h` and are asserted below the
//! way `docs/rw_audio_structs_check.c` asserts them in C.
//!
//! Everything here operates on **guest memory**: big-endian, byte-addressed, at guest
//! addresses. That is deliberate rather than idiomatic. These are recovered layouts with
//! asserted offsets, and Phase 4's per-function criterion compares *bytes* against the
//! verified C++ — so a byte-addressed view makes that comparison direct, instead of routing
//! it through a serialisation step that could hide a discrepancy of its own.
//!
//! Unsafe is not forbidden crate-wide the way it is in `skate-audio-formats`, because the
//! DSP modules will scope `unsafe` to intrinsic calls. Nothing in this file needs it.
