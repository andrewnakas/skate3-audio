//! The guest's scalar floating-point idioms, as the lifted PowerPC performs them.
//!
//! Nothing here is a port of a guest function. These are the recurring *instruction* shapes
//! that the verified C++ bodies spell out inline — `lfs`, `stfs`, `extsw`/`fcfid`/`frsp`, the
//! single-rounded arithmetic forms, and `fctiwz` — factored out so that every op in `eval`
//! rounds in the same places the original does. Each helper is named after the instruction
//! sequence it stands for, and none of them is allowed to be "simplified" into a plain `f32`
//! computation: the guest holds intermediates in 64-bit FPRs and narrows only where a `.s`
//! form appears, which is not the same thing as computing in `f32`.
//!
//! **Flush-to-zero. Corrected 2026-09-12 — this paragraph previously said the opposite.** It
//! claimed `ctx.fpscr.disableFlushModeUnconditional()` writes MXCSR `0x0000`, denormals
//! preserved. It does not. `rex/ppc/context.h` sets `fpu_csr |= FlushMask` when it initialises
//! the host FPU (line 214) and re-applies that mask on every rounding-mode change (line 227), so
//! the **scalar** side carries flush-to-zero and denormals-are-zero exactly as the vector side
//! does. The two "flush mode" calls differ only in *rounding mode*.
//!
//! What that changes here: nothing yet, and the reason is worth stating rather than assuming.
//! Every operation in this module is a conversion or a single arithmetic step on values the game
//! supplies, and no test in this crate drives one with a denormal. A denormal input or an
//! intermediate that underflows to one **would** differ between this code and the recomp, and
//! nothing here would catch it. Treat that as an open gap, not as a cleared one. `vmx.rs`
//! implements the real behaviour and models the CSR directly.
//!
//! Rust's `f32`/`f64` operators also run under the host default's *masked* FP exceptions where
//! the guest leaves them unmasked. Masking changes whether a trap fires, never the value
//! produced. (The recomp's own hooks have to care — an unmasked SIGFPE inside a guest call
//! killed the first capture tap.)
