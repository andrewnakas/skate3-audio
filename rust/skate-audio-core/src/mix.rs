//! The mix accumulator: flushing it, folding the pending deltas into it, and clearing ahead of it.
//!
//! Three verified bodies that between them own the block boundary. [`flush_accumulator`] runs once
//! per block on the mixer-side object: it swaps the row-owner pair, copies or clears each channel's
//! row, folds any pending deltas through [`fold_deltas`], and then zeroes the whole accumulator.
//! [`advance_and_clear`] is the other half of the same idea one level out — move a fill position
//! forward and clear that many frames in every channel of a buffer plan.
//!
//! | function | guest | `docs/ports.md` | lifted lines | calls/boot | calls/play |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|---|
//! | [`flush_accumulator`] | `sub_82B34E08` | verified | 176 | 722,892 | 845,754 |
//! | [`fold_deltas`] | `sub_82B3C668` | verified | 292 | 4,266 | 4,560 |
//! | [`advance_and_clear`] | `sub_82B443F8` | verified | 122 | 500,817 | 541,975 |
//!
//! [`fold_deltas`] is here because [`flush_accumulator`] calls it and nothing else in the corpus
//! does. Porting it separately would have left the flush with a hole on exactly the path that makes
//! it interesting — and `sub_82B3C668`'s own row arithmetic is the same `mullw`/`rlwinm` pair the
//! flush uses, written twice in the C++ and once here ([`row_offset`]).
//!
//! **Unit-tested against a verified reference**, the crate README's second kind of green: each C++
//! body was compared call-for-call against the original under the shadow harness at zero
//! divergence, on the real inputs those call counts come from. The Rust has no recorded vectors of
//! its own.
//!
//! Nothing in `docs/rw_audio_structs.h` names any of these structures. Every offset below is the
//! raw offset plus the use the lifted body makes of it.
//!
//! ## Reloads reproduced rather than hoisted
//!
//! All three bodies re-read their loop control out of memory on every pass — the channel count, the
//! row base, the row stride, the plan's buffer. The C++ `Windows()` builders treat a write span
//! that covers any of them as **not comparable** and decline the call, so a caller whose rows
//! overlap its own header is input the harness has never seen. The reloads are kept anyway, because
//! the originals have them; what that establishes is that they survived the transcription, not that
//! the guest agrees with the answer on those layouts.
//!
//! ## What is deliberately not claimed
//!
//! `sub_82B31838` — the neighbouring "mix one source's channels into the bus blocks" body — is
//! **not** here, and it is verified, so the reason is worth stating. It builds two pointer arrays
//! **on its own guest stack frame** (`r1 - 208 + 80` and `+ 112`) and hands them to its mixers, so a
//! faithful port needs the guest stack pointer as an argument and writes into a region no window
//! declares and no recorded vector contains. It also calls `sub_82B46810`, which has a verified C++
//! body that is not translated yet. Both are solvable; neither is solved here, and a version that
//! papered over either would be the kind of green this crate exists to avoid.
