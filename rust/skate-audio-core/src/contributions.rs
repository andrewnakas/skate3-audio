//! `sub_82B225A0` — republish one contribution into its owner's running total.
//!
//! Ported from `recomp/src/audio_ports/sub_82B225A0.inc`, **STATUS: verified** — 116,945 calls in a
//! played session on `RwAudioCore Dac`, compared against the original under the shadow harness.
//!
//! Replayed against **3,000 recorded calls, 0 disagreements**, 2,021 of them on the correction path
//! through [`crate::mathlib::log10`] — which makes them 2,021 more bit-exact checks of that
//! transcription too — and compared live against the original 77,379 times in the same session.
//!
//! The object is unnamed: `docs/rw_audio_structs.h` has no entry for it, so the offsets below keep
//! numbers and descriptive names. What the function does is bookkeeping on three words, and it is the
//! *difference* that makes it worth reading carefully — the owner's total at `+40` is updated by the
//! **change since the last publish**, not by the new value, so calling this twice is not the same as
//! calling it once with a doubled value.
//!
//! | mode at `+64` | what happens |
//! |---|---|
//! | exactly 1 | the length at `+140`, converted to a float, becomes the value; if the coefficient at `+92` is not the image's zero it is corrected through [`crate::mathlib::log10`]; the *uncorrected* value is published at `+28` and the corrected one at `+32` |
//! | anything else | withdraw: the owner's total loses whatever was last published, and both `+28` and `+32` settle at the image's zero |
//!
//! Four details that a plausible rewrite gets wrong, each with a test:
//!
//! - **`+28` and `+32` disagree on the correction path.** `+28` gets the raw converted length; `+32`
//!   gets the value after the correction is subtracted. A port that stored one value twice passes
//!   every test where the coefficient is zero, which is most of them.
//! - **The "is it zero" test compares against a word in the image**, not against a literal, and it is
//!   an *unordered* compare — so a NaN coefficient is "not equal" and takes the correction path.
//! - **The conversion is `fcfid` then `frsp`**: a signed 64-bit convert of the sign-extended `i32`,
//!   then rounded to single. Lengths past 2^24 lose their low bits.
//! - **The correction is two single-rounded operations**, `fmuls` then `fdivs`, not one expression.
//!
//! The withdrawal arm negates by flipping the sign **bit** (`fneg`) and then adds, which is not the
//! same as subtracting from zero: withdrawing a `+0.0` publish from a `-0.0` total leaves `-0.0`
//! this way, where `total + (0 - published)` would give `+0.0`.
//!
//! The 112-byte frame the original opens is not reproduced: it exists so `sub_82F55068`'s own frame
//! and its callee's scratch land below this one, and [`crate::mathlib::log10`] keeps all of that in
//! registers. Nor are the `r12`/`r31`/`f31` spills, since nothing here writes them.
