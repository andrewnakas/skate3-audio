//! `sub_82B43AF8` — the mixer's biquad, eight samples per pass.
//!
//! ```text
//! y[k] = (x[k]*b0 + x[k-1]*b1 + x[k-2]*b2 + bias) - y[k-1]*a1 - y[k-2]*a2
//! ```
//!
//! `docs/ports.md`: **verified**, 1,152,252 calls a boot and 1,592,578 in a played session — the
//! heaviest single body in the whole candidate set. Zero divergence, zero skipped.
//!
//! This is **unit-tested against a verified reference**, the crate README's second kind of green:
//! the C++ was compared call-for-call against the original under the shadow harness on those real
//! inputs, and the Rust below has no recorded vectors of its own. A fault here is a transcription
//! error rather than a misreading of the filter.
//!
//! ## The three things that are not "just a biquad"
//!
//! **A bias is added to every feed-forward sum.** `lfs f9,432(r8)` off the audio pool, added after
//! the three taps and before the recursive half — the classic denormal-avoidance constant. It is
//! read live through the guest map, never folded in ([`DENORM_BIAS`]).
//!
//! **The first two samples of each block round their taps in a different order** from the other
//! six, because they reach into the carried history. Sample 0 is
//! `x1*b1 + (x2*b2 + x[0]*b0)`; sample 1 is `x1*b2 + (x[0]*b1 + x[1]*b0)`; samples 2..7 are
//! `x[k]*b0 + (x[k-2]*b2 + x[k-1]*b1)`. Those are three different association orders over the same
//! three products and they do not agree bit for bit. They are spelled out rather than folded into
//! one loop for that reason.
//!
//! **The recursive half uses `fnmsubs`, which is fused.** `y = c - a*b` in one rounding
//! ([`fp::nmsub_single`]); a multiply followed by a subtract rounds twice and is a different
//! filter. Two of them chain per sample, and each output is the next sample's `y[k-1]`, so the
//! chain cannot be reassociated at all.
//!
//! ## What is not translated, and why
//!
//! **A count that is not a nonzero multiple of eight returns an `Err`.** The original hands those
//! straight to `sub_82B43978` — same arguments, same write set, a generic four-at-a-time loop plus
//! a remainder. That function has **no `.inc` in `recomp/src/audio_ports/`**: it is not one of the
//! 216 audio-thread functions the sweep covered, so there is no verified reference for it in either
//! language and translating it would be new analysis dressed as a transcription. Returning an
//! `Err` that names it is the same choice [`crate::eval::dispatch`] makes for an unported opcode,
//! and for the same reason: inventing an answer would turn a gap in coverage into a wrong one.
//!
//! **The frame is not reproduced.** The C++ moves `r1` down by 192 and writes the back chain,
//! solely so that `sub_82B43978`'s `f31` spill at `-8(r1)` lands where the original put it. With
//! that call gone there is no callee to make room for, and the back chain is inside this function's
//! own frame, which no window declares and no comparison sees.
//!
//! ## One thing reproduced rather than fixed
//!
//! **The history is written back even when the loop never runs.** A span that wraps the address
//! space (`in >= in + 4*count`) skips the filter entirely and still stores the four values it just
//! loaded, through a full `lfs`/`stfs` round trip. That is a no-op in value for everything except
//! a signalling NaN, and it is still four stores, so it is kept.
