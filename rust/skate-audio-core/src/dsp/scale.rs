//! `sub_82B3BED8` and `sub_82B44B20` — the mixer's two float-array multiplies.
//!
//! They are twins: the same two paths, the same path selector, the same end-pointer arithmetic and
//! the same write window, with a fused multiply-add against the destination in place of a plain
//! multiply. They share a file because reading either one alone hides how narrowly they differ.
//!
//! | | guest | does | `docs/ports.md` | calls/boot | calls/play |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|---|
//! | [`scale`] | `sub_82B3BED8` | `dst[i] = src[i] * k` | verified | 2,843,558 | 4,411,988 |
//! | [`scale_accumulate`] | `sub_82B44B20` | `dst[i] += src[i] * k` | verified | 3,738,884 | 6,110,212 |
//!
//! `sub_82B3BED8`'s green is the cleaner of the two to quote: session `s19` recorded
//! `runs=1057635 diverged: registers=0 memory=0 skipped=0 overflow=0`. `skipped=0` is the part
//! worth reading twice — `Windows()` answered on every one of the million calls rather than
//! declining, so the covering is as wide as it looks.
//!
//! ## Two paths, chosen from entry state alone
//!
//! ```text
//! vector   ((dst | src) & 0x7F) == 0  &&  (count & 0x3F) == 0
//! scalar   anything else
//! ```
//!
//! — both buffers 128-byte aligned and the count a multiple of 64. The vector path moves 32 floats
//! an iteration: eight `lvx128`, eight multiplies (or FMAs), a `dcbzl` on the destination line for
//! `sub_82B3BED8`, and eight `stvx128` **in the lifted order**, which is not ascending. Both loops
//! exit on the *source* cursor reaching `src + count*4`, never on a counter.
//!
//! ## The limits of the verification, carried over
//!
//! **The scalar path is unexercised.** Every logged entry has `count = 256` with both pointers
//! 128-byte aligned, so the million clean comparisons are all vector path. The C++ scalar path was
//! checked by a Python model of the lifted register machine against a model of the port over 111
//! cases — six alignment combinations, 18 counts including 1/3/7/17/63/65/127, three overlapping
//! layouts — agreeing on written bytes and written addresses. That checks addressing, loop counts
//! and store order, **not float rounding**. The same limit applies to the translation below, and
//! the tests here add the rounding half that the model could not: the scalar path is compared
//! against an independent per-element model with the same `fmuls`/`fmadds` structure.
//!
//! ## The two paths are not the same function
//!
//! They agree on every input the game passes, and they are not interchangeable. The vector path
//! narrows `f1` to a **single** before it multiplies — four `stfs` into the red zone and one
//! `lvx128` to read them back as four lanes — while the scalar path multiplies in **double** and
//! narrows the product. For an `f1` that is exactly representable as a single, which is what an
//! `lfs` in the caller guarantees and what the census shows (`1.0` and `0.0`, alternating), the two
//! agree bit for bit: the double product of two 24-bit values is exact, so narrowing it is the same
//! single rounding the f32 multiply performs. For any other `f1` they differ, and neither is wrong.
//! `a_scale_that_is_not_a_single_makes_the_two_paths_differ` pins it. This is a property of the
//! original, not of the translation, and it is written down because a reader who assumes the paths
//! are one function with two speeds will eventually be surprised by it.
//!
//! ## One divergence, forced by the guest map
//!
//! The vector loop terminates only when the source cursor lands exactly on `src + count*4` after
//! whole 128-byte steps. A span that is zero, or not a multiple of 128 — `count == 0` with both
//! pointers aligned, a negative count, a `count*4` that overflows — **never terminates**, and the
//! original hangs. The C++ reproduces the hang and its `Windows()` returns `false` on exactly that
//! class, so nothing is known about what the guest does there either. Here the cursor walks off
//! the segment and [`crate::Guest`] returns `Err` instead. That is a difference from the reference,
//! it is in the direction of not hanging a caller, and it is on input the harness has never
//! compared — so it resolves an unknown rather than contradicting a known.
