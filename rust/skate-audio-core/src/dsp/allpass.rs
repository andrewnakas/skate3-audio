//! `sub_82B389A0` — the four-lane one-multiply allpass stage, over an **unaligned** tap.
//!
//! Ported from `recomp/src/audio_ports/sub_82B389A0.inc`, **STATUS: verified** — 59,894 calls in a
//! played session on `RwAudioCore Dac`, compared against the original under the shadow harness.
//!
//! Per lane it is the one-multiply allpass pair, and then a gain-weighted accumulate:
//!
//! ```text
//! d   = c − a·t          (vnmsubfp, a first)
//! y   = a·d + t          (vmaddfp,  a first)
//! acc = y·g + acc        (vmaddfp,  y first — the operand order flips here)
//! ```
//!
//! Calling it an allpass is an inference from that shape; no symbol or plug-in metadata covers this
//! function. What the port reproduces is the arithmetic.
//!
//! ## Four things that decide whether a rewrite is right
//!
//! **The tap is read unaligned.** Every 16-byte group of `t` is `lvlx(p) | lvrx(p + 16)` — two
//! partial loads or'd together — while `c`, `d` and `acc` all go through aligned `lvx128`/`stvx128`.
//! So the tap may sit at any byte offset and the kernel still reads four consecutive floats per
//! lane group. [`the_tap_may_be_unaligned`] is that test.
//!
//! **The trip count is a ceiling, so the loop runs past `n`.** It is `ceil(quads / 4)` where
//! `quads = n / 4` truncating, which means a count whose quarter is not a multiple of four is
//! processed up to the next multiple of 16 samples. Reproduced — the C++ window builder declares the
//! same over-run — and [`the_trip_count_is_a_ceiling_and_overruns_the_count`] pins it.
//!
//! **`r10` decides whether the accumulator is cleared first**, and the clear is `dcbzl`: whole
//! 128-byte lines from `acc & !127`, so with an unaligned accumulator it reaches *below* the
//! pointer. [`the_clear_is_by_cache_line_from_the_floor`] asserts that.
//!
//! **Its result registers are `r3` and `v2`,** because its one call site is a tail call: `r3` is the
//! 64-bit `acc − c` delta and `v2` is the last tap group, both of which leave here as the caller's
//! own ABI results. `v29`, `v30` and `v31` are clobbered too — the last `c` group, the last `y`, and
//! the last accumulator group *before* its store — and the harness compares those unconditionally,
//! so they are returned rather than dropped.
//!
//! ## Two things not reproduced, with the reason
//!
//! The eight `stfs` that splat `a` and `g` into the frame at `r1-128` and `r1-112`, read straight
//! back by two `lvx128`: kept in registers here, which is [`crate::dsp::scale`]'s established
//! precedent and holds for the same measured reason — the guest `r1` at these entries is 16-byte
//! aligned, so the two loads see exactly four copies of each single. And `__savegprlr_21`'s spills,
//! since nothing here writes `r21`-`r31`.
//!
//! Note the `.inc`'s comments call each multiply-add "a single vmaddfp" and say the pair must not
//! become two rounded operations. That was the intent; the build does not deliver it. The recomp has
//! no FMA, so `vmaddfp` and `vnmsubfp` each round twice ([`crate::vmx`] rule 1), and this port goes
//! through the same layer as every other kernel here.
//!
//! **This kernel is the strongest evidence for that rule anywhere in the project.** Replayed against
//! 800 recorded calls it passes all 800 with two roundings and fails **701 of them** with one —
//! three multiply-adds per lane per sample will do that, where the sine kernel's tiny reduced
//! arguments disagreed on only 4 calls in 2,000. Measured by patching the layer and re-running, not
//! argued.
