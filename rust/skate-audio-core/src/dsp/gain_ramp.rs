//! `sub_82B3C098` and `sub_82B44D18` — a gain-ramped copy of a fixed 256-single block, and its
//! accumulating sibling.
//!
//! | function | guest | `docs/ports.md` | lifted lines | calls/boot | calls/play |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|---|
//! | [`gain_ramp_copy`] | `sub_82B3C098` | verified | 278 | 2,126,778 | 3,023,068 |
//! | [`gain_ramp_accumulate`] | `sub_82B44D18` | verified | 402 | 34,866 | 71,847 |
//!
//! Both are replayed against recorded gameplay: 166 vectors for the copy and 31 for the
//! accumulate, 0 disagreements.
//!
//! Both `.inc` headers lead with `// STATUS: verified` and `docs/ports.md` agrees. They share a file
//! because they share everything but the last step: the same thirteen rodata cells in the same roles,
//! the same two-loop shape, the same literal 1024-byte extent. `sub_82B44D18` differs in three places —
//! every group is a `vmaddfp` **into** the destination instead of a `vmulfp128` over it, there is no
//! `dcbzl`, and it clobbers all eighteen of `v14`-`v31` rather than four. Its only caller in the audio
//! set that matters here is `sub_82B298E0` ([`crate::gains::ramp_gain_matrix`]), which runs this
//! kernel for every source channel after the first.
//!
//! What follows up to the next heading is about `sub_82B3C098`, and was written before its sibling
//! joined it.
//!
//!
//! `STATUS: verified`, zero divergence over 902,638 compared calls in one boot session, at
//! **2,126,778 calls per boot** and 3,023,068 per played session on `RwAudioCore Dac`. A leaf: no
//! callees, no imports, no indirect calls, no timebase.
//!
//! `dst[k] = src[k] * gain(k)` for `k` in `0..256`, where `gain(k) = f1 + k*f2` for the first 64
//! samples and `f1 + 64*f2` for the remaining 192. **The length is not a parameter**: `src + 256`
//! and `src + 1024` are both literal in the lifted body, so every call touches exactly 1024 bytes
//! in and 1024 out.
//!
//! ## What this port had to reason out, and what later measured it
//!
//! `probe/ports/notes/sub_82B3C098.md` records that the C++ inferred five constants from the
//! register plumbing and **did not measure them** — "no image dump was taken for this port" — while
//! being careful to load every one through the guest map so that nothing depended on the guess.
//! Those inferences are now checked. Reading the validated dump (`probe/harness/out/image/`) at the
//! addresses below gives exactly what the note predicted:
//!
//! | cell | inferred | measured |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`STEP_SCALE`] | 4.0 | 4.0 |
//! | [`RAMP_SPAN`] | 64.0 | 64.0 |
//! | [`LANE2_SCALE`] | 2.0 | 2.0 |
//! | [`LANE3_SCALE`] | 3.0 | 3.0 |
//! | the eight pool vectors | splats of 1 … 8 | splats of 1 … 8, in the mapped order |
//!
//! So the register-plumbing reading of which pool vector scales which 16-byte group is confirmed,
//! not merely consistent. The body below still reads all thirteen cells live, for the same reasons
//! the C++ does: it is what the original does, and a patched image should reach the port.
//!
//! ## The two vector materialisations
//!
//! The lifted body builds two vectors through its own red zone — four `stfs` then one `lvx128` —
//! and neither is reproduced as a memory write. `stfs` writes big-endian and `lvx128` reverses all
//! sixteen bytes, so **the two reversals cancel**: the single written at `-96(r1)` comes back as
//! host lane 3. That is the fact the whole per-lane gain ordering rests on, and the harness settled
//! it over 900,000 calls rather than it being argued here.
//!
//! ## Rule 4 and the clobbers
//!
//! Sixteen `vmaddfp` and sixteen `vmulfp128` sites, every one with the lifted operand order. See
//! [`crate::dsp`] for why that is necessary and not sufficient.
//!
//! The original clobbers `v28`-`v31` — inside the ABI-preserved range the harness compares on every
//! call — and never saves them: it uses `__savegprlr_23`, not `__savevmx_*`. So four group
//! multipliers are compared whether or not the result mask names anything, and
//! [`GainRampClobbers`] is those four.
//!
//! ## What no test here can catch
//!
//! Four of the seventeen `vmaddfp` sites are multiply-adds by a **power of two** — the group-1,
//! group-2 and group-4 multipliers and the whole-block step of 8 — and a product by a power of two
//! is exact, so at those four sites a fused multiply-add and a separate multiply-then-add are the
//! same function rather than two answers that happen to agree. Rewriting any of them the wrong way
//! leaves every test in this crate passing. That was measured by making the change and watching the
//! suite, not assumed; the same change at group 3 or group 5, where the multiplier is not a power of
//! two, fails `it_matches_the_independent_model_bit_for_bit`. All seventeen go through
//! [`vmx::vmaddfp`], which rounds twice as the recomp does. *Corrected 2026-09-13:* this said
//! "fused", and the measurement above was taken under that reading.
