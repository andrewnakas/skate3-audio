//! `sub_824531C8` — four-lane sine: range reduction, then an 11-term odd polynomial.
//!
//! The hottest function in the audio set by two orders of magnitude: **9,572,672 calls in a boot
//! session and 9,906,721 in a played one**, on `RwAudioCore Dac`. `STATUS: verified` with zero
//! divergence over 6,994,118 compared calls, which makes it the strongest evidence in the project.
//! It is also the function that motivated the harness's `ShadowResults` mask: it has **no stores at
//! all**, its result lives in `v1`, and before the mask existed comparing it checked nothing on
//! eight million calls — a total vacuous green (`probe/ports/notes/sub_824531C8.md`).
//!
//! It is a leaf, it takes no pointer, and it reads only four rodata vectors. So the translation
//! risk is concentrated in exactly three places, all of which the tests below aim at:
//!
//! 1. **The `vspltw128` immediates are reversed** and every coefficient comes through one. A
//!    single wrong immediate picks a different coefficient and the function still runs.
//! 2. **Every `vmaddfp` rounds twice, as the recomp computes it.** The recomp is built without FMA,
//!    so each Horner step is a multiply and then an add. *Corrected 2026-09-13:* this said
//!    single-rounding, and under that reading 1,996 of 2,000 recorded calls replayed and 4 did not;
//!    with two roundings all 2,000 do. The chain is eleven steps, alternating with eleven
//!    `vmulfp128`, and any step written as a fused `mul_add` rounds once where the recomp rounds twice.
//! 3. **It clobbers `v31`**, which the ABI preserves and the harness compares unconditionally, so
//!    the clobber is part of the observable result.
//!
//! ## The constants, read live and checked against the image
//!
//! The four coefficient vectors are at `0x82300000` minus 26544 / 26688 / 26672 / 26656. Each
//! address is asserted below as `((lis_imm & 0xFFFF) << 16) + offset`, **computed** and never read
//! off the disassembly by eye — one misread digit of a `lis`-based address in `sub_82B2FE00` cost
//! this project its first shadow divergence.
//!
//! Their values, read out of the validated image dump (`probe/harness/out/image/g_8220.bin`), are
//! the Taylor series of sine and `1/2π`:
//!
//! ```text
//! 0x822F9850  A  pi          2*pi        1/pi        1/(2*pi)
//! 0x822F97C0  B  1.0         -1/3!       1/5!        -1/7!
//! 0x822F97D0  C  1/9!        -1/11!      1/13!       -1/15!
//! 0x822F97E0  D  1/17!       -1/19!      1/21!       -1/23!
//! ```
//!
//! (guest word order, most significant first). The body loads every one of them **through the guest
//! map** rather than folding the numbers in, because that is what the original does and because a
//! patched image should reach the port. The dump values are used only by the tests, and only to
//! give them a genuinely independent oracle — `f64::sin` — which is what makes a wrong splat
//! immediate or a swapped lane visible instead of merely self-consistent.
