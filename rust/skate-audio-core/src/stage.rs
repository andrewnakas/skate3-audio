//! One mixer filter stage: the five-gain kernel, and the dispatcher that feeds it.

//!
//! Both `.inc` headers lead with `// STATUS: verified` and `docs/ports.md` agrees. `sub_82B399D0` is
//! **901 lifted lines**, the largest body translated into this crate, and its C++ port measured zero
//! divergence over 141,462 comparisons with `skipped=0`.
//!
//! **They share a file because they cannot be separated.** `sub_82B399D0` has no `stwu` of its own and
//! reads three of its arguments off `84(r1)`, `92(r1)` and `100(r1)` — which is `sub_82B39FA0`'s frame.
//! Porting the kernel alone would have meant inventing a signature for those three, and porting the
//! dispatcher alone would have left its only interesting path a stub. Here [`run_stage`] builds the
//! frame and [`one_pole_stage`] reads it out of guest memory, exactly as the pair does in the original,
//! so the coupling is exercised rather than modelled.
//!
//! **Unit-tested against a verified reference**, the crate README's second kind of green: the C++ was
//! compared call-for-call against the original under the shadow harness on real inputs at zero
//! divergence, and the Rust has no recorded vectors of its own. A fault here is a transcription error
//! rather than a misreading of the kernel; it is not a number.
//!
//! ## What the kernel computes
//!
//! Three interleaved passes over the same run, which is why reading the lifted body linearly is so
//! hard. Written out, with `i` the sample index and the operations in the precision each uses:
//!
//! ```text
//! mixed[i] = addend[i] - feed·source[i+1]                    f32 vnmsubfp, four lanes at a time
//! y[i]     = mixed[i] - pole·y[i-1]                          f64 fnmsubs, in place over mixed
//! copy[i] += bus_gain·(bus_coeff·source[i] + source[i+1])     f32 vmaddfp, two of them
//! ```
//!
//! `y[-1]` is the `f5` argument, and the result is `y[count-1]` — **read back out of memory**, not kept
//! in a register. [`run_stage`] latches it into its gain block's `+32`, which is where the next call's
//! `f5` comes from, so the recursion is continuous across calls.
//!
//! `source` is read at both `i` and `i+1`, so it holds `count + 1` singles. Every group is therefore
//! built from **two** `lvx128` and a `vperm128`: the run is only 4-byte aligned in the census
//! (`0x…388` and `0x…3C0` both appear), so an aligned vector load of it would be at the wrong offset.
//!
//! ## The software pipeline, and why the covering works out
//!
//! The kernel writes the first sixteen samples of `mixed` before its loop, and each iteration then
//! (a) runs the scalar recursion over the sixteen samples the *previous* pass wrote, (b) accumulates
//! the bus from the *previous* pass's source windows, and (c) computes the *next* sixteen `mixed`
//! samples and new windows. A tail block after the loop finishes the last sixteen.
//!
//! For a count that is a multiple of sixteen the three cursors tile the run exactly:
//! `blocks = count/4 - 4`, `iters = ceil(blocks/4) = count/16 - 1`, and the tail sits at
//! `16·blocks = count - 16`. Every sample of `mixed` and of `copy` is visited once. **For any other
//! count they do not tile** — a count of 20 gives one iteration covering samples 0…15, a `mixed`
//! write of samples 16…31 past the end of the run, and a tail that re-filters samples 4…19. That is
//! reproduced rather than guarded, and it is why the tests here only model multiples of sixteen: the
//! census logs `count = 0x100` on every call.
//!
//! ## Flush-to-zero is toggled twenty-one times mid-body
//!
//! `docs/vmx128-exactness.md` rule 2, at its sharpest. The recursion's `fnmsubs` and the bus's
//! `vmaddfp` are **interleaved instruction by instruction**, and the lifted body emits a
//! `disableFlushMode` before each scalar operation and an `enableFlushMode` before each vector one. A
//! single global choice would flush a denormal the recomp keeps, or keep one it flushes, on any sample
//! near the bottom of the range. Every toggle is reproduced at its own site through
//! [`crate::vmx::Fpscr`], including the guarded `enable_flush_mode`/`disable_flush_mode` forms where
//! the lifted line uses those rather than the unconditional ones.
//!
//! ## Rule 4, once
//!
//! Every `vnmsubfp` takes the `feed` **splat** as its first operand and every `vmaddfp` takes the
//! window or the product first, as lifted. That is necessary and not sufficient: rule 4 records that
//! with two NaN operands the surviving payload is a register-allocation decision in clang-20 as much as
//! in GCC, so it cannot be derived from source in either language. If NaN reaches this kernel its
//! output is not predictable from this code *or* from the C++.
//!
//! ## Reproduced rather than fixed
//!
//! - **The 32-byte permute table is rebuilt in `.data` on every call**, at the fixed address
//!   [`PERM_TABLE`], and read straight back through four `lwzx` to form each control. It is a real
//!   write to guest memory — the C++ `Windows()` declares it — and it is a write to a *shared* address,
//!   so two threads in this kernel at once would race. Written as eight `stw` in the lifted order,
//!   which is not ascending.
//! - **`dcbzl` is a real 128-byte store**, not a hint, and it starts from the 128-byte **floor** of
//!   `copy` and covers `ceil(4·count / 128)` whole lines — so it can zero bytes past the end of the
//!   run. `dcbt`, which sits next to it in the same loops, *is* a hint and lifts to nothing.
//! - **The state for each block is reloaded from memory** (`lfsu f0,64(r11)`) rather than carried in a
//!   register, so a misaligned `mixed` whose `stvx128` clobbered the low bytes of `run+60` would feed
//!   the next block the clobbered value.
//! - **The second single of each block is stored before the first** (`stfs f0,8(r11)` then
//!   `stfs f12,4(r11)`).
//!
//! ## Not reproduced, and one of them is a real output
//!
//! The kernel's own frame — three `stfd` of `f29`-`f31` at `-96`…`-112(r1)` and `__savegprlr_22`'s
//! spill at `-8`…`-88(r1)` — is not reproduced. The body leaves those registers untouched, so the
//! epilogue's restores are no-ops, and there is no register file here in any case.
//!
//! **`v25`-`v31` are a different matter.** The kernel clobbers seven vector registers in the
//! ABI-preserved range without saving any, and the C++ port tracks exactly what the last block through
//! the pipeline left in each so that the harness's unconditional `v25`-`v31` comparison passes. This
//! crate has no vector register file, so **that output is simply absent here** — a difference from the
//! reference, listed rather than buried. It costs nothing for replay: the vector recorder captures
//! `r3`…`r8`, `f1`…`f4` and the returned `f1`, and the kernel's mask is `kReturnF1`, so `f1` is the
//! whole of what a recorded comparison can check.
//!
//! [`run_stage`]'s two register spills (`stw r12,-8(r1)` for the link register and `std r31,-16(r1)`)
//! are absent for the same reason. Its frame's **back chain** is written, because that value is
//! `entry_sp` and this crate does have it.
