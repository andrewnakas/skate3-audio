//!
//! Every one of those `.inc` headers leads with `// STATUS: verified`, and `docs/ports.md` agrees
//! with all five — checked before translating, because a `thin` or `gate-` header means the C++ was
//! never compared on enough calls, or not on the path being translated, and is not a reference.
//!
//! The three that take a gain array are called in sequence over the same array by the same two
//! callers, `sub_82B45440` and `sub_82B460A0`; the second loops with `r6 += 32` and `r4 += 16`, which
//! is where the 32-byte gain array and the 16-byte source record come from. The two 5.1/7.1 speaker
//! counts and the four speaker indices at `+172` are read by all three.
//!
//! ## What the green here means
//!
//! **Unit-tested against a verified reference**, the crate README's second kind of green. The C++
//! body each of these was translated from was compared call-for-call against the original under the
//! shadow harness, on the real inputs those call counts come from, at zero divergence. The Rust has
//! no recorded vectors of its own yet, and two of these cannot have any until `mathlib`'s sine and
//! cosine are ported — see [`add_angular`] and [`place_panner`].
//!
//! ## Reads no `Windows()` declares — which is what makes some of these unreplayable today
//!
//! A read the C++ `Windows()` does not declare is not recorded, so a vector that reaches it cannot
//! be replayed against this crate; feeding fabricated bytes instead would turn a failure into a
//! meaningless pass. Three of the five reach such a cell, and every one is a *rodata constant*, so
//! the fix is one `spec.read` line in the `.inc` and costs nothing against the window budget:
//!
//! | function | undeclared read | why it is reached |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`place_panner`] | [`ONE_SINGLE`], [`SNAP_SINGLE`] | its callee `sub_82B453D8` reads both |
//! | [`add_angular`] | [`ZERO_SINGLE`] | sector 1's initial centre share |
//! | [`add_angular`] | `mathlib::POOL_STEP_DOWN`, `mathlib::POOL_INTEGRAL_MAGNITUDE` | `sub_82F4DE80` reads both |
//!
//! [`ZERO_SINGLE`] is a difference from the C++ rather than from the original: `sub_82B45788`'s port
//! writes `double centre = 0.0;` with the lifted `lfs f12,23056(r11)` in the comment beside it. The
//! original loads the cell, so this port loads it too, per the crate's rule that guest constants are
//! read live. On the measured image the cell is `0.0` and the two agree exactly.
//!
//! ## The constants, measured
//!
//! Every cell below is read live through the [`Guest`] map, and every address is computed from its
//! `lis` immediate and asserted at compile time. The values are from the validated image dump
//! (`probe/harness/out/image/`) and are recorded here because two of them settle what these
//! functions are *doing*, not merely that the addresses are right:
//!
//! | cell | address | measured | what it makes the code mean |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | [`ONE_SINGLE`] | `0x8231A844` | 1.0 | |
//! | [`SNAP_SINGLE`] | `0x820ED800` | 0.999 | the unit-disc snap window |
//! | [`ZERO_SINGLE`] | `0x82165A10` | 0.0 | |
//! | [`HALF_SINGLE`] | `0x8209975C` | 0.5 | `weight = 1 - 0.5·distance` |
//! | [`EPSILON_SINGLE`] | `0x821A0318` | 0.0005 | the front/back snap band |
//! | [`TURNS_PER_RADIAN`] | `0x822F8904` | 0.15915494 | **1/2π** |
//! | [`RADIANS_PER_TURN`] | `0x820B411C` | 6.2831855 | **2π** |
//! | [`DEGREES_TO_RADIANS`] | `0x822F8A6C` | −0.017453292 | **−π/180** |
//! | [`HALF_TURN`] | `0x82060C44` | 3.1415927 | **π** |
//!
//! The first pair settles [`add_angular`]'s reduction: multiply by `1/2π`, take the floor, keep the
//! fraction, multiply by `2π`. That is an angle **wrapped into one turn**, and the sector bound at
//! `+60` is added before the wrap and subtracted after it, so the seven sectors partition
//! `[-bound0, 2π - bound0)`. The second pair settles [`place_panner`]'s argument: `f1` is an angle in
//! **degrees**, negated into radians, and the `depth <= 0` path adds half a turn — a reflection
//! through the origin, which is what a negative radius means.
//!
//! ## What no test here can catch
//!
//! Three things these bodies do are reproduced because the originals do them and **not** because
//! anything in this crate would notice their absence. Each was measured the way the crate's other
//! such notes were — by making the change and watching all 275 tests stay green — rather than
//! argued from the code:
//!
//! - **[`pan_distance`] reloads all four indices between the four stores.** Replacing them with the
//!   entry values leaves the suite green. The two *count* reloads on the same path are pinned, by
//!   `the_count_is_reloaded_between_the_index_stores_and_the_fixed_ones`; the index reloads are not,
//!   because an index that changed mid-call would have to be overwritten by one of this function's
//!   own float stores, and the resulting `4·index` is then a wild address rather than another slot.
//!   The C++ `Windows()` refuses that layout outright, so nothing is known about it in either
//!   language.
//! - **[`add_angular`] reads the second index of sectors 2, 5 and 7 *after* the first store.**
//!   Hoisting sector 2's read above its store leaves the suite green, for the same reason.
//! - **[`clamp_to_unit_disc`] stores x and y before it computes the length.** Moving both stores
//!   after the `fmadds` leaves the suite green: the only input that could tell them apart is an
//!   `out` that overlaps the rodata cell the load in between reads, which is not a layout any
//!   caller can produce.
//!
//! ## Rule 4, once, for all five
//!
//! Every float operation is written with its operands in the lifted order, including the commutative
//! ones — `mul_single(depth, gain172)` here and `mul_single(rear180, depth)` two lines later are the
//! two orders the original uses and they are not normalised. `docs/vmx128-exactness.md` rule 4
//! establishes that with two NaN operands the surviving payload is chosen by register allocation, in
//! clang-20 as much as in GCC, so it cannot be derived from source in either language. If a NaN ever
//! reaches a speaker position or a source record, these outputs are not predictable from this code
//! or from the C++.
//!
//! Nothing in `docs/rw_audio_structs.h` names either structure. Every offset below is the raw offset
//! plus the use the lifted bodies make of it, and the speaker-table reading is an inference from the
//! offset arithmetic that `probe/ports/notes/sub_82B454B8.md` already flags as such.

/// `sub_82B454B8` — pan a 2D source into the speaker-gain array by distance.
///
/// `object` is `r3`, `input` is `r4` (the record [`clamp_to_unit_disc`] writes), `gains` is `r6` and
/// `focus` is `f1` — the caller's own weight for speaker 1, used only when the count is not 4.
/// No result (`kReturnNone`); `f1` is left holding `depth · gain172`, which neither caller reads and
/// the harness mask does not compare, so it is not returned here.
///
/// Writes, all inside `gains`:
///
/// | path | words |
/// |---|---|
/// | `input+8 == 1.0` | `+0`…`+16` as raw zero `stw`, then `+20`/`+24` as `0.0f` when the count is 8 |
/// | otherwise | `4·index` for each of the four indices, `+4` when the count is ≥ 6, `+20`/`+24` when it is 8 |
///
/// Reads the 12-byte record, the count, the four indices, the speaker pairs they select, speakers 5
/// and 6 when the count is 8, speaker 1 when it is not 4, and [`ONE_SINGLE`], [`ZERO_SINGLE`],
/// [`HALF_SINGLE`], [`EPSILON_SINGLE`].
///
/// The arithmetic: `weight_k = 1 − 0.5·|speaker_k − source|`; `front = 0.5·(x + 1)` and
/// `back = 1 − front`, each snapped to zero inside 0.0005; the front pair is normalised by
/// `sqrt(front / Σweight²)` over two weights at a count of 4 and over three otherwise, the third
/// being speaker 1's weight times `focus`; the back pair by `sqrt(back / Σweight²)` over speakers 5,
/// 6 and indices 184, 180. Every stored gain is then scaled by `sqrt(1 − lensq²)`, with `lensq`
/// **reloaded** from the record after the first pass over it.
///
/// **The count and all four indices are reloaded from the object between the stores.** That is why
/// the C++ `Windows()` declines any call whose gain array overlaps `object + 172..+187`: a later
/// store address would not be derivable from entry state. The reloads are reproduced here, so a

/// [`Sector::Front`]. The guest function is void (`kReturnNone`); the [`Sector`] returned here is
/// not a guest value, it is this port telling its tests which branch ran.
///
/// Writes **two words** of `gains` per call, never more: two of the fixed slots `+4`/`+12`/`+16`/
/// `+20`/`+24`, or two of `gains + 4·index`, plus `gains + 4` in the one sector that has a centre
/// channel. Every store is a read-modify-write — the old gain is loaded and the contribution is
/// **mix-added** — so this accumulates over sources rather than replacing.
///
/// Reads the 16-byte record, `object + 56..+187` (the count, three bounds, the centre scale, six
/// coefficient blocks and the four indices), [`TURNS_PER_RADIAN`], [`RADIANS_PER_TURN`],
/// [`ZERO_SINGLE`], and `mathlib`'s two pool doubles through [`mathlib::floor`]. The last three are
/// **not** in the C++ `Windows()`, which is why a recorded vector for this function cannot be
/// replayed yet even once the trigonometry exists.
///
/// ## The reduction
///
/// `scaled = (record+12 + bound0) · 1/2π`; `fraction = scaled − frsp(floor(scaled))`;
/// `reduced = fraction · 2π − bound0`. With the two constants measured, that is an angle wrapped
/// into one turn with the sector ladder rotated by `bound0`. The `frsp` is not decoration: it
/// narrows the floor to a single before the subtraction, so the fraction a caller gets is the one
/// the original computed and not a more accurate one.
///
/// ## Two structural details a reader would simplify away
///
/// - In the three index-pair sectors ([`Sector::FrontSide`], [`Sector::Rear`], [`Sector::Back`]) the
///   **second index is read after the first store**. In the three fixed-slot sectors both old gains
///   are loaded before either store. The shared tail `loc_82B45B3C` is therefore inlined at each of
///   its three arrival points rather than factored out.
/// - Arriving at `loc_82B45A80` from the `bge` above it re-tests the same value, so that arm always
///   falls through to [`Sector::Back`]; [`Sector::RearWide`] is reachable only through the
///   `count > 6` branch. Written as `inside && count <= 6` then `inside && count == 8`, which is the
///   same set of paths.
///
/// ## What is not reproduced
///
/// `stwu r1,-160(r1)`. The C++ **does** reproduce it, because the sine and cosine helpers spill
/// `f30`/`f31`/`f10` at `r1-8 … r1-32` and would otherwise land 160 bytes higher than the original
/// put them. Here those two are a [`Trig`] parameter rather than guest code, so no callee spills
/// anything and there is nothing to make room for — the same position `crate::dsp::biquad` is in
/// with its own frame. **If `sub_82F4DED0` and `sub_82F4DFB0` are ever ported as guest bodies that
/// write their red zone, this frame becomes load-bearing again** and this port needs the entry `r1`
/// as an argument. The back chain itself is inside this function's own frame, which no window
/// declares and no comparison sees.
///
/// The `__savegprlr_29`/`__savefpr_27` spills and the matching restores are likewise not
/// reproduced: there is no register file here, and `fmr f27,f31` writes a register that
/// `__restfpr_27` immediately overwrites.
