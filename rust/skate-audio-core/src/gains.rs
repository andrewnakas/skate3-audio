//! The gain plumbing: the two bodies that drive the DSP kernels over a channel descriptor.
//!
//! Both take a descriptor — `+4` channel 0's float array, `+14` a `u16` count of singles between one
//! channel and the next — walk its channels, and hand each one to a kernel that
//! [`crate::dsp`] already has. They are the layer between [`crate::spatial`], which decides *what*
//! gain a speaker gets, and the kernels, which apply it to samples.
//!
//! | function | guest | `docs/ports.md` | lifted lines | calls/boot | calls/play | kernel |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
//! | [`apply_gain_matrix`] | `sub_82B29AF0` | verified | 143 | 245,762 | 404,782 | [`crate::dsp::scale`] |
//! | [`ramp_channels`] | `sub_82B23B50` | verified | 119 | 292,165 | 435,555 | [`crate::dsp::gain_ramp`] |
//! | [`ramp_gain_matrix`] | `sub_82B298E0` | verified | 319 | 142,508 | 180,524 | [`crate::dsp::gain_ramp`], both kernels |
//!
//! All three are replayed against recorded gameplay — 795 + 185 + 404 vectors, 0 disagreements.
//! `sub_82B298E0`'s delta frame is its own stack, so a call with no source rows reads bytes no
//! recording holds; the replay counts those unreplayable rather than seeding them (there were none).
//!
//! `sub_82B298E0` joined the first two later, and is [`apply_gain_matrix`] with a ramp: the same matrix,
//! the same two passes, the same carried destination count, but every gain moves from the value the
//! caller saved before this block to the one the matrix holds now, over the kernels' 64 samples. It is
//! the one body here that **does** reproduce its own frame, because its deltas live there and are read
//! back by `lfsx`; see [`ramp_gain_matrix`].
//!
//! Both `.inc` headers lead with `// STATUS: verified` and `docs/ports.md` agrees. They are here
//! rather than in `dsp/` because neither is a kernel: they contain no sample arithmetic at all, only
//! loop bounds, gain-cursor arithmetic and channel addresses.
//!
//! **Unit-tested against a verified reference**, the crate README's second kind of green. The C++
//! bodies were compared call-for-call against the original under the shadow harness on real inputs
//! at zero divergence; the Rust has no recorded vectors of its own.
//!
//! ## The three arithmetic rules these two exist to get right
//!
//! Neither function does anything interesting with floats — one `lfsu` per gain, one `fsubs` and one
//! `fmuls` for a ramp step. What they do is **compute addresses**, and `CLAUDE.md` names all three
//! traps:
//!
//! 1. `mullw` is a **64-bit** product of two sign-extended words, so `stride * channel` can exceed
//!    32 bits before anything truncates it;
//! 2. `rlwinm rX,rX,2,0,29` is a 32-bit shift left by two of the product's **low word** — the
//!    rotate's wrapped bits are masked off;
//! 3. `add` is 64-bit on two zero-extended words, so a channel address can **carry into bit 32**,
//!    and only the callee's own address truncation drops it. Keeping the chain in 64 bits and
//!    casting at the call is the rule that surfaced on the 120th call of another function.
//!
//! [`channel_address`] is that chain, written once and used by both. `crate::mix`'s `row_offset` is
//! the same `mullw`/`rlwinm` pair with the sum taken in 32 bits, because its caller adds in 32 bits;
//! the two are deliberately not shared.
//!
//! ## Reloads reproduced rather than hoisted
//!
//! Every loop bound and every descriptor field is re-read from guest memory on each pass:
//! `sub_82B29AF0` reloads the destination count after **every** kernel call and both descriptors'
//! base and stride on every iteration; `sub_82B23B50` re-reads the applied gain, both strides and
//! both buffers per channel. Both C++ `Windows()` builders decline a call whose output covers any of
//! those words, so a caller whose buffers overlap its own control block is input the harness has
//! never compared. The reloads are kept because the originals have them; what that establishes is
//! that they survived the transcription, not that the guest agrees on such a layout.
//!
//! One reload is load-bearing rather than defensive, and it is worth reading twice.
//! `sub_82B29AF0`'s destination count lives in **one** variable across both passes: the second pass
//! tests whatever the *last* reload of the first pass left there, not a fresh read. If the count was
//! zero at entry the first pass never runs, the variable is still the entry value, and the inner loop
//! stays skipped for every source. Modelling it as two variables would be wrong.
//!
//! ## What no test here can catch
//!
//! Four of these reproductions are invisible to every test in the crate. Each was measured — the
//! change made, all 275 tests re-run, all still green — not argued:
//!
//! - **The `int32_t` casts in [`channel_offset`]'s `mullw`.** Zero-extending both operands instead
//!   gives the identical answer *always*, not merely on these inputs: only the product's low word
//!   survives the `rlwinm`, and a signed and an unsigned multiply agree on every low word. So the
//!   64-bitness of `mullw` cannot be observed through this function at all. It is written signed
//!   because the instruction is, and the rule it protects lives one line down, in the **add**, which
//!   `a_channel_address_is_a_64_bit_sum_of_a_32_bit_offset` does pin.
//! - **[`ramp_channels`] re-reads the applied gain on every iteration.** Nothing inside the loop
//!   writes that word, so hoisting the load is invisible. What is *not* invisible is moving the
//!   tail's latch into the loop, which `every_channel_ramps_from_the_same_starting_gain` catches —
//!   that is the mistranscription this reload actually guards against.
//! - **[`apply_gain_matrix`] carries one destination count across both passes.** The C++ note is
//!   emphatic that "modelling that as two variables would be wrong", and it is right about the
//!   transcription — but replacing pass 2's test with a fresh read leaves the suite green, and the
//!   reason is stronger than "these inputs do not reach it": pass 1's last act before exiting is to
//!   reload that word, and nothing writes it between then and pass 2's test, so the carried value
//!   and a fresh read **cannot** differ on any input. Kept as the original has it.
//! - **[`apply_gain_matrix`] re-reads both descriptor fields on every iteration.** Hoisting them out
//!   of the inner loop is invisible, for the same reason the C++ `Windows()` declines a call whose
//!   output covers them: no comparable input makes them change mid-call.
//!
//! ## What is not reproduced
//!
//! `sub_82B29AF0`'s `stwu r1,-160(r1)`. The C++ **does** reproduce it, because both kernels spill
//! `f1` and their callee-saved registers below the live `r1` and read that scratch back. The Rust
//! kernels keep those values in registers instead — `crate::dsp::scale`'s own note says so — so
//! nothing in this chain writes the guest stack and there is nothing to make room for. Same position
//! `crate::dsp::biquad` is in with its own frame.

/// matrix rows the delta loop visits, the saved matrix, both descriptors, [`MATRIX_RAMP_STEP`], the
/// source channels, the destination channels (the accumulate reads its accumulator), the thirteen
/// cells the kernels read, and the deltas back out of the frame.
///
/// Reproduced rather than fixed, each as the lifted body has it:
///
/// - **The delta loop's test is signed and the pass bounds are unsigned.** `cmpwi r10,0 ; ble` skips
///   the deltas for any count with bit 31 set, while `cmplwi r10,1 ; ble` then sends that same count
///   into pass 2.
/// - **With no delta rows, pass 1 still runs and reads the frame as it found it.** A source count of
///   zero and a non-zero destination count skip step 1 and run step 2, whose `lfsx` loads deltas this
///   call never wrote. The original reads whatever the stack held; so does this, because the deltas are
///   guest memory here and not locals.
/// - **Past eight destinations the cursors walk into the next row** — the saved-gain cursor into the
///   next saved row, the delta cursor into the next delta row or past the written ones. The matrix has
///   eight columns and nothing bounds the destination count against it.
/// - **The deltas' store addresses are `row + (r1 + 80 + 4c − r6)`**, built by six `subf` on 64-bit
///   registers and truncated only at the store. That equals `sp − 352 + 32·s + 4·c` modulo 2^32 for
///   every `r6`, and it is written the lifted way below; the store order (columns 0, 2, 3, 5, 4, 6, 7,
///   1) and the differencing order (2, 3, 0, 5, 4, 6, 7, 1) are kept too.
/// - **The source base is read once, before pass 1**, and not per destination; pass 2 re-reads the
///   source descriptor for every source row. The destination count is reloaded after every kernel
///   call and carried across both passes in one variable, exactly as in [`apply_gain_matrix`].
///
/// Not reproduced: `__savegprlr_22`'s spill of `r22`-`r31` and the link register into
