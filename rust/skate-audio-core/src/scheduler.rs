//! The scheduler's instance and bucket-list layer.
//!
//! `docs/PLAN.md` section 6 asks this module for the "two-bucket tick, per-plug-in profiling
//! toggle, mid-tick self-removal (`scheduler + 0x4C`)". **Only the last of those three is here,
//! and that is a limit of the evidence, not of effort.** The tick itself is `sub_82B48A50`, whose
//! recorded status is `gate-1`: it calls each node's own process function through a `bctrl`, and
//! it reads the timebase through `sub_82B1F7E8` (`mftb`) twice per node, so it fails gate 3 as
//! well. Neither language has a verified reference for it, and `docs/ports.md` is the authority on
//! that. Writing a Rust tick would be new analysis dressed as a transcription, so it is not here.
//!
//! What *is* here is the half of the protocol the tick cooperates with: an instance removing
//! itself, and the intrusive list mechanic that removal runs on.
//!
//! | function | guest | `docs/ports.md` status | lifted lines |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | [`detach_instance`] | `sub_82B489D0` | verified | 71 |
//! | [`recycle_node`] | `sub_82B39690` | verified | 82 |
//!
//! Both were compared call-for-call against the original under the shadow harness at zero
//! divergence — 1,997 and 3,994 calls per boot session respectively. As with `counter.rs` and
//! `eval/`, **the Rust has no recorded vectors of its own**: the harness brackets these two but
//! does not record per-call inputs for them, so what the tests below buy is a small search space,
//! not a replay count. See the crate README's "two kinds of green".
//!
//! **Two things here are reproduced rather than tidied, and no test in this crate catches their
//! absence.** Both were checked by breaking them and watching the whole suite still pass:
//!
//! - [`recycle_node`] re-reads the node's two link words between the two neighbour stores rather
//!   than hoisting both loads. Hoisting them differs only when a neighbour's link field overlaps
//!   the node's own, which none of the tests below constructs;
//! - [`detach_instance`] loads `instance + 0` *after* storing the parked bucket index, which
//!   differs only if that store lands on the node pointer — and that is exactly the input the C++
//!   `Windows()` predicate refuses as its gate-2 exit, so it was never compared in either
//!   language.
//!
//! The one reload that *is* pinned by a test is `recycle_node`'s second read of the free head; see
//! `the_free_head_is_re_read_after_the_nodes_link_words_are_written`, and read its comment before
//! quoting it, because the input it uses was never compared either.
//!
//! **A struct-header correction, carried over from the C++ port.** `docs/rw_audio_structs.h`
//! labels `rw_instance + 0x00` as `descriptor -> rw_plugin_desc` and `rw_node + 0x00` as `next`.
//! What both of these functions actually do with those cells is follow `instance + 0` to a node
//! and clear that node's `+8` back pointer, and treat `node + 0` as the *previous* link and
//! `node + 4` as the next. The names below describe the arithmetic, and
//! `probe/ports/notes/sub_82B489D0.md` reaches the same reading.
