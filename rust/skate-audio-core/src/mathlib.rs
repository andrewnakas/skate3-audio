//! The guest C runtime's float leaves that the audio thread reaches, and the hole where two of
//! them are.
//!
//! Three functions live at `0x82F4DE80`, `0x82F4DED0` and `0x82F4DFB0`. They are not audio code —
//! they are the image's `floor`, sine and cosine — but the spatial layer cannot be written without
//! them, so they get a module of their own rather than being buried in [`crate::spatial`].
//!
//! | | guest | does | `docs/ports.md` | calls/boot | calls/play |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|---|
//! | [`floor`] | `sub_82F4DE80` | `floor(double)`, register-only leaf | verified | 2,872,661 | 2,942,889 |
//! | [`Trig::sine`] | `sub_82F4DED0` | sine | **no `.inc` at all** | — | — |
//! | [`Trig::cosine`] | `sub_82F4DFB0` | cosine | **no `.inc` at all** | — | — |
//! | [`log10`] | `sub_82F55068` | `log10(double)`, one callee | verified | 125,566 | 169,118 |
//! | [`log`] | `sub_82F54ED8` | that callee: the natural log | **outside the corpus** | — | — |
//! | [`atan2`] | `sub_82F52318` | `atan2(y, x)`, octant-reduced rational atan | verified | 87,372 | 56,807 |
//!
//! [`atan2`] is replayed against **3,015 recorded calls**, compared by the bits of `f1` and by the
//! sixteen bytes it spills into its caller's frame.
//!
//! [`log10`] is replayed against **3,000 recorded calls, compared by the bits of `f1`** and so is
//! [`log`] with it, since every one of those calls goes through it. That is what stands behind the
//! transcription of a body with no verified reference of its own.
//!
//! `sub_82F4DE80` is the hottest body anyone has ported in this project: 2.87 million calls in a
//! boot session on `RwAudioCore Dac`, more than the sine kernel and the two buffer multiplies put
//! together.
//!
//! ## The two that are not here, and why they are a trait
//!
//! `sub_82F4DED0` and `sub_82F4DFB0` are **outside the 216 audio-thread functions the native sweep
//! covered**, so neither language has a verified reference for them — the same position
//! `crate::dsp::biquad`'s delegate `sub_82B43978` is in. Writing a sine here would be new analysis
//! dressed as a transcription, and substituting `f64::sin` would be worse: it would turn every
//! future comparison of `sub_82B45788` and `sub_82B269C0` from a failure into a meaningless pass,
//! because the two functions differ in their last mantissa bits and the callers `frsp` the result
//! into a single where that difference survives about half the time.
//!
//! So they are a [`Trig`] parameter. [`Unported`] is the default and returns an `Err` naming the
//! guest address — the same choice `crate::eval::dispatch` makes for an unported opcode. [`Closures`]
//! lets a caller that *has* an implementation supply one. The trait takes `&Guest` because the real
//! bodies almost certainly read a polynomial out of the image, and a future port of them must be
//! able to.
//!
//! **Consequence for replay, stated rather than left to be discovered:** a recorded vector for
//! `sub_82B45788` or `sub_82B269C0` cannot be replayed against this crate until those two are
//! ported. Their results feed every value the two functions store.
//!
//! ## The constants, measured
//!
//! `probe/ports/notes/sub_82F4DE80.md` records that its two pool doubles were **not** read from the
//! image — "by shape they are 1.0 and 2^52" — while being careful to load both through the guest
//! map. Reading the validated dump (`probe/harness/out/image/`) at those addresses:
//!
//! | cell | address | inferred | measured |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | [`POOL_STEP_DOWN`] | `0x82010108` | 1.0 | **1.0** |
//! | [`POOL_INTEGRAL_MAGNITUDE`] | `0x820514D8` | 2^52 | **1e18** (`0x43ABC16D674EC800`) |
//!
//! The second inference is **wrong**, and the port is unaffected because it reads the cell live.
//! 1e18 is a coherent choice where 2^52 is only a plausible one: it is the largest round decimal
//! magnitude comfortably below `2^63`, which is the bound `fctidz` needs in order not to produce
//! its integer indefinite. Above it every double is already an integer anyway, so the arm that
//! returns `x` unchanged is correct for the whole range it covers. That is noted here and recorded
//! in this session's report; nothing else in the tree depends on the old guess.

///
/// The parts a rewrite gets wrong, all of them pinned by the tests:
///
/// - **Four special cases come out of the image, not out of arithmetic.** `log(1)` returns the
///   `0.0` *cell*; `log(0)` returns the negation of the `+inf` cell; a negative argument and a NaN
///   argument both return the negation of the NaN cell, which is `0x7FF8000000000000` — so an input
///   NaN's payload is **discarded**, not propagated. `log(+inf)` returns its argument, decided by
///   a `> DBL_MAX` test rather than by a class check.
/// - **The exponent test is integer.** `lhz` of the double's top halfword, `& 0x7FF0`, compared
///   against `0x7FF0`. The body never asks `is_nan`.
/// - **The denormal branch is dead in this build, and reproduced anyway.** It scales by `2^53` and
///   biases the exponent by 1075 instead of 1022. Under the flush mode RexGlue actually runs
///   (`FZ|DAZ` in *both* of its modes — [`crate::vmx::Fpscr`]), a denormal argument compares equal
///   to zero, so the body returns −inf before reaching it. On hardware without `DAZ` the branch is
///   live, which is why it is here.
/// - **Every multiply-add is a scalar `fma`,** one rounding, and the divides are plain `fdiv`.
///   That is `std::fma` in the lifted body and `mul_add` here; it is unrelated to the two-rounding
///   vector multiply-adds of [`crate::vmx`].
///
/// Not reproduced: the spills at `16(r1)` and `−16(r1)`. They move a double's bits into a GPR and
/// back, which is what `to_bits`/`from_bits` do here, and the `.inc` for [`log10`] reproduces the
