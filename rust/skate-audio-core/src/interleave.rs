//! `sub_82B46B30` — six planar float channels into 24-byte frames, with a channel remap.
//!
//! Ported from `recomp/src/audio_ports/sub_82B46B30.inc`, **STATUS: verified** — 54,900 calls in a
//! played session on `RwAudioCore Dac`, compared against the original under the shadow harness.
//!
//! Replayed against **600 recorded calls, 0 disagreements**, and compared live against the original
//! 14,338 times in the same session.
//!
//! The last stage before the mixer hands a block to the driver: six separate plane buffers become
//! one run of interleaved frames. Three things about it are not what the name suggests.
//!
//! **It is a remap, not a straight interleave.** Plane *p* does not land at slot *p*. The six store
//! offsets, read off the instructions and identical in both loops, are:
//!
//! | plane | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
//! | byte slot in the frame | +0 | +8 | +4 | +16 | +20 | +12 |
//!
//! and the *store order* is plane 1, 2, 4, 3, 0, 5 — which matters only if the source aliases the
//! destination, and is kept for that reason. [`LANES`] is that order.
//!
//! **The length is a literal, not a field.** `addi r4,r5,1024` adds 1024 bytes to the cursor's own
//! register, so every call that gets past the first compare writes exactly 256 frames — 6,144
//! bytes — whatever the descriptor says. That constant is what makes the write set enumerable from
//! entry state, and it is why 30 flagged stores collapse to one span.
//!
//! **The guard is a 32-bit compare of 64-bit values.** `start` and `start + 1024` are compared on
//! their low words, so the function returns having written nothing only when the addition carries
//! out of 32 bits. [`the_low_word_compare_is_the_only_early_out`] builds that case.
//!
//! The tail loop is **unreachable** for a 1024-byte span: the unrolled loop's trip count,
//! `(span - 13) / 16 + 1`, is 64, and 64 × 4 frames consumes all 256. It is transcribed anyway, as
//! the C++ port does, so the body stays faithful if the literal ever changes.
//!
//! One thing the round trip does *not* buy: the C++ note says the `lfs`/`stfs` pair quiets a
//! signalling NaN the way the lifted form does. That is true only unoptimised — LLVM folds
//! `fptrunc(fpext(x))` away, and clang can do the same to the recomp (`examples/flush_probe`, and
//! the note in [`crate::vmx::Fpscr`]). The pair is written here because it is the shape of the
//! original, and no claim is made about what either language does to a NaN.
