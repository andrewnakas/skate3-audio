//! `sub_82B1F360`: the six-word cascading counter at guest `0x830775F0`.
//!
//! Ported from `recomp/src/audio_ports/sub_82B1F360.inc`, **STATUS: verified** — 6,624 calls
//! per boot on `RwAudioCore Dac`, compared against the original under the shadow harness.
//!
//! This is the engine's only source of variation: no timebase, no lock, no allocation, no
//! indirect call, just six words that accumulate into each other and a low word that ticks by
//! one per call. Two evaluator ops draw from it — `eval::state::op_random_in_range` (slot 7)
//! and `eval::state::op_weighted_cursor` (slot 9) — which is why it lives in its own module
//! rather than inside `eval`: it is shared state those ops reach through, not an opcode.
//!
//! **Not a PRNG in the usual sense.** Each call sums the words upward with carry and returns
//! the top total, so successive draws are strongly correlated; slot 9 takes it modulo 100 and
//! slot 7 modulo an arbitrary range. Whatever its statistical merits, reproducing it exactly is
//! the requirement, and its exactness has a specific history: see [`advance`].

/// on the 120th call — registers `94BF290A01000000` against `00000000`. That is the concrete
/// reason this module does not use `u32` arithmetic, and why callers that only need the low word
/// (the two evaluator ops both store `u32`) still receive `u64` here.

/// re-stores each word it increments. The order is observable only to a concurrent reader, and
