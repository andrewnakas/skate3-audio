//! The RwAudio expression evaluator: the 40-slot opcode table at guest `0x82FD3600`.
//!
//! The interpreter `sub_82B1E290` walks a list of nodes, each `{ +0 next, +8 program, +12 operand
//! block }`. A program is a stream of records
//!
//! ```text
//! { u8 opcode, u8 pairs, 2 unread, { u32 src, u32 dst } pair[pairs], u32 block_advance }
//! ```
//!
//! and for each record it calls `TABLE[opcode]` with the operand block in `r3`. The returned `r3`
//! is then **consumed**: for every pair whose `src` is `-1` the interpreter stores the result's low
//! word into `block[dst]`, and any other `src` is a block-to-block copy. Opcode 255 ends the
//! stream. That is what makes every op here `s32 op(block*)` with no direct call site anywhere in
//! the lifted tree, and why each one's whole result is the value it returns.
//!
//! **This module is the table's slots; the interpreter is [`interp`], unverified new work (2026-09-14).** `sub_82B1E290` itself fails the port
//! screen's gate 1 — its `bctrl` dispatches a data word, so its callee set is whatever the program
//! bytes name — and gate 2, since its write set is the union over an unbounded node list of an
//! unbounded record stream whose store addresses the dispatched ops may rewrite mid-walk. It has no
//! verified C++ body to translate, so there is none here. [`dispatch`] provides the *table lookup*
//! the interpreter would perform, which is testable on its own; a Rust interpreter would still need
//! the node walk, the period arithmetic and the pair machinery, and would be new work rather than a
//! transcription.
//!
//! ## Where the table came from
//!
//! Read out of the validated guest image dump at `probe/harness/out/image/g_82E0.bin`, offset
//! `0x1D3600`. The table is exactly 40 entries: slot 39 is the last word that decodes as a text
//! address, and slot 40 onward is unrelated data (`0xF22D0E56`, then what looks like a fixed-point
//! table). Three of the notes in `probe/ports/notes/` had independently identified slots 23, 24,
//! 25, 29, 30, 31 and 36 from the same dump; reading the whole range agrees with all seven and
//! fixes the remaining thirty-three.
//!
//! ## Coverage
//!
//! **All 31 slots that have a verified C++ body are ported, plus slots 1 and 2** (2026-09-14): those
//! two are single-instruction accessors outside the audio corpus (`lwz r3,20(r3); blr` and
//! `lwz r3,24(r3); blr`), not shadow-verified, and needed by every player bank's program. Of the 9
//! slots without a verified body:
//!
//! - **Three fail the port screen's gate 1** and have no verified reference in either language:
//!   slots 4, 27 and 39 (`sub_82B1C150`, `sub_82B1D240`, `sub_82B1C450`), each because it makes an
//!   indirect call — a vtable release, a handler-list notify, a closure that leaves the audio
//!   corpus entirely.
//! - **One is a pending path split**: slot 5 `sub_82B1C210` has a C++ body as of 2026-09-12, but
//!   `STATUS: pending` — the harness can compare it only on the inputs that skip its
//!   `sub_828E29C0` broadcast. Nothing unverified is translated here, so it waits.
//! - **Five are outside the 216 audio-thread functions** (1 and 2 now ported as above): slots 1, 2, 19, 20 and 38 have no `.inc`
//!   at all, so nothing has been screened for them. Slots 1 and 2 are not even in the audio corpus.
//!
//! The C++ side moves: this coverage reflects `recomp/src/audio_ports/` as of 2026-09-12, and
//! `python3 probe/ports/queue.py report` is the live answer. A slot whose `absent` text no longer
//! matches its `.inc` header is a signal that a port became translatable, not a bug in the table.
//!
//! ## Verification status of what *is* here
//!
//! Every ported op is a transcription of a `STATUS: verified` C++ body — compared call-for-call
//! against the original recompiled code under the shadow harness, on real inputs the running game
//! generated. **The Rust is not itself replayed against recorded vectors.** That distinction is the
//! one the crate README draws and it holds here: `system.rs`, `player.rs` and `buffers.rs` have
//! numbers attached (8,607 comparisons), and these ops have a proven *reference* but only unit
//! tests of their own. A divergence in one of them is a transcription error, which is a far smaller
//! search space than a misreading of the engine — but it is not zero.
