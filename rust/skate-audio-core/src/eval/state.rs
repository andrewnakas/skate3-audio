//! The evaluator's stateful slots: eight ops that hold something across calls.

//! All eight are transcriptions of `STATUS: verified` bodies. These are where the evaluator stops
//! being a calculator — a hysteresis latch, a timer, two cursors, a ramp, a delay line, a shuffle
//! bag and a draw from the shared counter — and they are also where the store ordering starts to
//! matter, because several of them reload a word they have just written.
//!
//! Three of them reach outside their own object: [`op_random_in_range`], [`op_weighted_cursor`] and
//! [`op_shuffle_bag`] all call [`crate::counter::advance`], whose 24-byte global is the only state
//! in the evaluator that is not per-instance. The C++ `Windows()` predicates for all three *refuse*
//! the call when the op's own record overlaps that global, because then the fields reloaded after
//! the call would no longer derive from entry state; there is no analogue of that refusal here,
//! since nothing in Rust is being bracketed, but the overlap remains a real hazard for a caller that
//! lays objects out itself.
