//! The evaluator's numeric slots: thirteen ops that read an operand block and write nothing.
//!
//! Every function here is a transcription of a `STATUS: verified` body in
//! `recomp/src/audio_ports/`. None of them stores anything, so the whole of each op's observable
//! effect is the value it returns, which is why the returns are `u64` and not `i32`: the
//! interpreter keeps only the low word (`stwx r3,dst,block`), but the shadow harness compares all
//! 64 bits of `r3`, and several of these ops legitimately leave bits above 31 set.
//!
//! **The 64-bit rule, which cost a real divergence.** RexGlue's `add` and `mullw` operate on
//! 64-bit registers holding zero-extended 32-bit loads. A sum of two `u32` fields carries into
//! bit 32 instead of wrapping; a `subf` that borrows fills the upper word with ones; `mullw`
//! keeps the full 64-bit product of two sign-extended words. Truncating any of those chains to 32
//! bits leaves memory byte-identical and the return value wrong, which is exactly the failure the
//! C++ hit in `counter::advance`. Intermediates stay 64-bit here and narrow only at a store or a
//! comparison that the original performs on low words.
//!
//! **The `tw` traps are not reproduced.** Four of these ops carry `twllei`/`twlgei` guards around
//! their divides. In RexGlue a type-0 `ppc_trap` logs a warning and returns: it changes no
//! register and no memory, so omitting it is exact rather than approximate. Each is noted where it
//! occurred, because it marks the input that reaches the divider's overflow case.
