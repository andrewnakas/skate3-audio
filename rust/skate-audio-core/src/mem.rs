//! The XDK block routines the ported bodies call out to, as guest functions.
//!
//! `sub_82EDF460` (memcpy), `sub_82EE5E80` (memset) and `sub_82F52040` (a **second** memset entry
//! point) are not audio functions, have no `.inc` of their own, and are not ported here as
//! instruction streams. What every verified port that calls one of them relies on — and states in its
//! `Windows()` comment — is a claim about their **write set**, established by reading their lifted
//! bodies through rather than assumed:
//!
//! > each writes exactly `[dst, dst + n)` and nothing else, on every path — the `dcbz`/`stvlx`/
//! > `stvrx` forms round into that interval and are then fully overwritten, and their spills go
//! > below their own `r1`.
//!
//! That is the whole of what the callers depend on, so that is what this module provides. It is a
//! narrower claim than "these are ports of `sub_82EDF460` and `sub_82EE5E80`", and the difference
//! matters in exactly one place, named below.
//!
//! ## What is not reproduced
//!
//! **Overlapping `memcpy` is not pinned.** [`memcpy`] snapshots the source before it writes, which
//! is what a non-overlapping copy produces and what the C-library contract permits an
//! implementation to do. The guest routine is a vectorised copy whose behaviour on an overlapping
//! span is a property of its load/store schedule, and nothing in this project has read that
//! schedule out. No call site here passes an overlapping pair: `sub_82B3DB90` copies ring → output
//! buffer and `sub_82B34E08` copies accumulator → row, and both of their `Windows()` builders
//! refuse the layouts where those could coincide. If a future caller can overlap, this is the line
//! to come back to.
//!
//! **A zero length writes nothing and never touches the address.** The guest routines test the
//! count first, so a null or unmapped `dst` with `n == 0` is not a fault there and is not one here.
//! Without that early exit [`crate::Guest`] would reject the address and turn a legal no-op into an
//! `Err`.
//!
//! A length that runs past the end of the guest map is an `Err` rather than a partial write, which
//! is [`crate::Guest`]'s convention everywhere: the harness's own window builders refuse those
//! calls as over-budget or unbounded, so nothing is known about what the guest does with them
//! either.
