//! The mix dispatcher over the six-pointer stage descriptor, and the two-source crossfade it runs.
//!
//! | function | guest | `docs/ports.md` | lifted lines | calls/boot | calls/play |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|---|
//! | [`crossfade`] | `sub_82B3D0A8` | verified | 662 | 93,954 | 111,902 |
//! | [`run_mix`] | `sub_82B3D4F8` | verified | 76 | 136,586 | 225,914 |
//!
//! Both `.inc` headers lead with `// STATUS: verified` and `docs/ports.md` agrees. One caveat on the
//! dispatcher's label, which its own note raises: until 2026-09-12 its `Windows()` refused every
//! two-gain call, so the label was first earned on the one-gain path alone. Every harness log since
//! (`probe/harness/out/vec_mixb.log` through `trig_boot.log`) shows it at `skipped=0` over 84,825 to
//! 137,561 runs a session, so both of its paths are compared now.
//!
//! ## The family this belongs to
//!
//! Three dispatchers read one 24-byte descriptor through `r7` and a gain block through `r3`, and
//! choose on the descriptor's `+8`: [`crate::stage::run_stage`] (`sub_82B39FA0`), [`run_mix`] here, and
//! [`crate::allpass::run_allpass`] (`sub_82B38B68`). `+16` and `+20` are the two buffers written on
//! every path of all three, and `+16`/`+20` of the gain block are its first two singles. The offsets
//! below are asserted against `stage`'s at compile time, so the three readings cannot drift apart
//! silently.
//!
//! What `+8` *means* is the one thing that differs: a selector in `run_stage`, a bypass flag in
//! `run_allpass`, and here **a pointer** — the crossfade's second source. Zero means there is nothing
//! to crossfade with, so the one-gain kernel [`crate::dsp::scale_add`] runs instead.
//!
//! **They share a file for the reason [`crate::stage`]'s pair do.** `sub_82B3D0A8` has no `stwu` and
//! reads its ninth argument, `F`, off `84(r1)` — the slot `sub_82B3D4F8` stores into its own fresh
//! frame immediately before the call. [`run_mix`] writes that slot and [`crossfade`] reads it back out
//! of guest memory, so the coupling is exercised rather than modelled.
//!
//! ## What the green here means
//!
//! **Unit-tested against a verified reference**, the crate README's second kind of green, with one
//! qualification that matters for the kernel. `sub_82B3D0A8.md` records that every call the game makes
//! arrives with `B` and `C` misaligned (`0x…4D8`, `0x…4EC`) and a count of 128, so **only the four-wide
//! scalar path has ever been compared** by the harness. The vector path and the one-at-a-time tail have
//! a C++ body but no evidence behind it. For those two paths this translation was checked against the
//! **lifted body directly**, instruction by instruction — every effective address reduced to its
//! array's base plus an offset in 32-bit wrapping arithmetic, and every operand order read off the
//! lifted line — and it agrees with the C++ at every site. That is a transcription check, not a
//! measurement.
//!
//! ## What the kernel computes
//!
//! Six float arrays and two gains. With `A` the accumulator, `B` and `C` the two sources, `D` a
//! per-sample coefficient, `E` and `F` the outputs:
//!
//! ```text
//! F[i] = D[i]·C[i] + (1 − D[i])·B[i]                       the plain blend
//! E[i] = A[i] + ((1 − D[i])·B[i])·gain_b + (D[i]·C[i])·gain_c   the weighted blend, accumulated
//! ```
//!
//! ## Three paths, and more rounding shapes than paths
//!
//! | path | taken for | `F` | `C`·`D`·`gain_c` | the `1.0` |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|
//! | vector, 16 a pass | `16·⌊count/16⌋` elements, only if `B` **and** `C` are 16-byte aligned | three roundings: `mul`, `mul`, `add` | `(D·C)·gain_c`, f32 | built by `vupkd3d128` |
//! | four-wide scalar | whole groups of four from where the vector path stopped | one `fmadds` | lanes 0, 1: `(C·D)·gain_c`; lane 2: **`(D·gain_c)·C`**; lane 3: `(D·C)·gain_c` | loaded from [`ONE_CELL`] |
//! | one at a time | the remainder | one `fmadds` | `(D·C)·gain_c` | loaded |
//!
//! Lane 2 of the four-wide loop associates its weighting differently from the other three: one
//! algebraic expression, two roundings of it, in one loop body. Each site is written the way it is
//! lifted. `C·D` against `D·C` is the other difference in that column and it is **not** observable on
//! numbers: the two products are the same value, and differ only in which NaN payload survives, which
//! `docs/vmx128-exactness.md` rule 4 puts beyond what source can decide. They are copied anyway.
//!
//! The gains reach the paths differently too: the vector path narrows each to a single once (four
//! `stfs` and one `lvx128`), while the scalar paths multiply by the guest FPR in double. They agree for
//! any gain that is already a single, which [`run_mix`]'s `lfs` guarantees; they are not one function.
//!
//! ## Reproduced rather than fixed
//!
//! - **Only `B` and `C` are alignment-tested.** On the vector path `A`, `D`, `E` and `F` go through
//!   `lvx128`/`stvx128`, which mask the address down to 16 bytes, so a misaligned `E` or `F` is written
//!   **low**: the words below the pointer are clobbered and the top of the nominal run is not written.
//! - **`A` is loaded after the four `F` stores** in each vector pass, and each quarter of it after the
//!   previous quarter's `E` store, so an `A` that aliases `F` feeds back the blend just written.
//! - **The scalar paths reload `B`, `C` and `D` after every `E` store**, so an `E` that aliases one of
//!   them computes `F` from the value just stored.
//!
//! ## Not reproduced
//!
//! The kernel's frame, none of which a caller can read back: `stw r3,20(r1)` (the count's home slot,
//! which sits in the **caller's** frame, at [`COUNT_HOME_SLOT`]), `__savegprlr_14`'s spill of `r14`-`r31`
//! and the link register at `-152(r1)`…`-5(r1)`, the two gain splats at `-192(r1)`…`-161(r1)`, and the
//! three spills at `-224(r1)`…`-201(r1)`. The splats are built as registers instead, which is exact only
//! when the frame is 16-byte aligned — see [`crate::vmx::splat_frame_unaligned`] for what happens when
//! it is not. `r14`-`r31` and every vector register the kernel touches (`v0`-`v13`, `v32`-`v63`, all
//! volatile) have no model here, and none is part of its result.
//!
//! The dispatcher's `stw r12,-8(r1)` (the link register) is absent for the same reason. Its back chain
//! and its outgoing argument slot are written, as [`crate::stage::run_stage`] writes its own.
