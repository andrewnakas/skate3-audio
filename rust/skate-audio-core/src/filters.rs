//! The per-channel filter stages: a low-pass, a high-pass, and the coefficient builder they share.
//!
//! Both stages take the same filter object in `r3` and the same stream in `r4`, normalise a cutoff
//! out of the object's `+52` and the stream's sample rate, and then either run
//! [`crate::dsp::biquad`] over 256 frames of every channel and swap the stream's descriptor pair, or
//! **bypass** — clear the filter history and leave the pair alone, so the caller keeps reading the
//! untouched input block. They are mirror images of one another and they are not symmetric, which is
//! the main thing this file exists to make visible.
//!

//! |---|---|---|---|---|---|

//!
//! The shelf pair is replayed against **3,000 recorded calls, 0 disagreements** — 2,996 for the stage
//! and only 4 for the thin builder, which rebuilds coefficients that rarely; its unit tests carry the
//! rest. The peaking equaliser is **unit-tested only** for now: its recording session lost its display
//! (the frame clock stopped, no audio thread came up) and never reached gameplay.
//!
//! Every one of those `.inc` headers leads with `// STATUS: verified` and `docs/ports.md` agrees on
//! all three — checked before translating, because a header reading `thin`, `partial` or `gate-`
//! would not be a reference at all.
//!
//! `build_lowpass_coefficients` is not in the same call-count league as the other two and it is here
//! because [`lowpass_stage`] **calls** it: the low-pass builds its five coefficients in a separate
//! guest function, and the high-pass builds the same five inline. Porting the stages without it would
//! have left the low-pass's recompute path as a stub, which is the only part of it a test can drive.
//!
//! ## What the green here means
//!
//! **Unit-tested against a verified reference**, the crate README's second kind of green. Each C++
//! body was compared call-for-call against the original under the shadow harness, on the real inputs
//! those call counts come from, at zero divergence. The Rust has no recorded vectors of its own, and
//! for these three it cannot have any yet — see the [`Trig`] note below. A fault here is a
//! transcription error rather than a misreading of the engine; it is not a number.
//!
//! ## Nothing in `docs/rw_audio_structs.h` names this object
//!
//! Every offset below is the raw offset plus the use the two lifted bodies make of it. No field name
//! here is recovered from RTTI or from plug-in metadata, and none should be read as one. The
//! `+56`/`+184` pair does carry one real constraint: `(184 - 56) / 16 == 8`, so the state array holds
//! at most eight channels and a ninth would run into the coefficients. Both C++ `Windows()` builders
//! decline a channel count above eight for that reason — a corrupted object rather than a case to
//! compare — and [`MAX_CHANNELS`] records it without enforcing it, because the original does not.
//!
//! ## The two stages are mirrors, and the mirror is not exact
//!
//! | | [`lowpass_stage`] | [`highpass_stage`] |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | bypasses when | `!(cutoff < ceiling)` | `!(cutoff > floor)` |
//! | clears history when the cache was | `< ceiling` | `> floor` |
//! | then clamps to | the **floor**, from below | the **ceiling**, from above |
//! | coefficients | `sub_82B43CC0` | built inline |
//! | numerator | `1 - cos` | `1 + cos` |
//! | `b1` | `+(1-cos)/a0` | `-(1+cos)/a0`, through an `fneg` |
//!
//! Both bypass tests are **unordered**: a NaN cutoff fails `<` and fails `>`, so both stages bypass
//! on it. Both clamps are strict, so a cutoff exactly on its bound is left alone.
//!
//! Reading the four coefficient cells out of the validated image dump makes the arithmetic legible
//! rather than merely transcribed. They are `0.5`, `1.0`, `-2.0` and `2.0` — three of which this crate
//! already names from [`crate::spatial`]'s own reading of the same dump — so with
//! `alpha = 0.5·sin w` and `a0 = 1 + alpha` both bodies are the textbook RBJ biquad at Q = 1, every
//! coefficient divided through by `a0`:
//!
//! ```text
//! a1 = -2cos/a0   a2 = (1-alpha)/a0
//! low-pass    b0 = b2 = (1-cos)/(2a0)   b1 =  (1-cos)/a0
//! high-pass   b0 = b2 = (1+cos)/(2a0)   b1 = -(1+cos)/a0
//! ```
//!
//! ## `Trig`, and what it costs
//!
//! Both recompute paths reach the image's sine and cosine, `sub_82F4DED0` and `sub_82F4DFB0`, which
//! **have no port in either language** — outside the 216 audio-thread functions the sweep covered, so
//! there is no `.inc` to transcribe. They are therefore a [`Trig`] parameter, exactly as in
//! [`crate::spatial`], whose default [`crate::mathlib::Unported`] returns an `Err` naming the guest
//! address rather than a plausible number.
//!
//! The consequence is narrower here than in `spatial`, and worth stating precisely: a call whose
//! cutoff equals the cached cutoff never asks for a sine, so it runs to completion under `Unported`
//! and **is** replayable. Only a call that recomputes is not. The same applies to the whole bypass
//! path, which never reaches trigonometry at all.
//!
//! ## Reproduced rather than fixed
//!
//! - **The channel count is re-read from `+42` at the bottom of every loop**, in all three loops here,
//!   so a filter pass that stored over the object's own header would change its own trip count. Both
//!   C++ `Windows()` builders decline a layout where that could happen, so nothing is known about what
//!   the guest does with it; the reload is kept because the original has it.
//! - **The state pointer walks on the callee's `r3`.** `addi r3,r3,16` is applied to whatever
//!   `sub_82B43AF8` left in `r3`, and that function never writes it — so the walk depends on the
//!   callee returning its first argument untouched. [`crate::dsp::biquad`] has no return value to read,
//!   so the walk is written as `state + 16` with this note attached rather than as a register read.
//! - **`sub_82B43CC0` computes `b2` with a second `fdivs` of the same two operands** instead of copying
//!   `b0`. Two single-rounded divides of identical operands agree, so this is invisible in value; it is
//!   written out because a `fmuls` by `0.5` or a copy would not be the same instruction.
//! - **`sub_82B26568` stores its five coefficients in the order 184, 188, 192, 200, 196**, which is
//!   not ascending. Kept.
//!
//! ## What no test here can catch
//!
//! Two things, each measured the same way the crate README's other entries were — the change made,
//! the whole suite re-run, all still green — rather than argued from the arithmetic.
//!
//! - **The coefficient store order.** The five stores go to five **distinct** words with five distinct
//!   values, so a single-threaded comparison cannot order them in either direction: reversing `+196`
//!   and `+200` leaves every byte of the object identical. Written in the original's order because the
//!   original has it; `b1` and `b2` are separately asserted to hold the right values, which is all a
//!   test here can establish.
//! - **The `frsp` on the *sine*, in all three bodies.** Its only consumer is `alpha = fmuls(sine, 0.5)`
//!   and scaling by a power of two commutes with rounding to single, so `(x·0.5)→f32` equals
//!   `(x→f32)·0.5` for every non-denormal `x`. Removing that one `frsp` leaves the suite green. The
//!   `frsp` on the **cosine** is a different matter and is pinned, because its consumer is
//!   `fsubs(1, cos)` / `fadds(cos, 1)`, where a tail below the single's last bit survives as a
//!   non-zero difference — see `the_cosines_double_tail_is_discarded_by_the_frsp`.
//!
//! ## Not reproduced, and why
//!
//! Neither stage's register spill is reproduced: the originals save `f29`-`f31` and `r26`-`r31` because
//! their callees may clobber the volatile file, and the C++ ports keep the entry values in locals for
//! the same reason. There is no register file here, so nothing is written to memory in any version.
//!
//! `sub_82B43CC0`'s `stwu r1,-112(r1)` is **also** not reproduced, and that one is a decision rather
//! than an absence. The C++ port does reproduce it, because its two callees are real guest bodies whose
//! spills land below `r1` and would otherwise overwrite this function's own. With the trigonometry as a
//! parameter there is no callee to make room for — the same reasoning `spatial::add_angular` records
//! for its own `stwu r1,-160(r1)`.

///
/// **Writes**, as the union of both paths: the five coefficients and the cache at `+184`…`+207`; the
/// four state words of every channel at `+56 + 16i`; the two descriptor words at `stream + 28`; and,
/// on the filtering path only, 1 KB per channel through the destination descriptor. Reads `+42`,

/// descriptors, 1 KB per channel through the source descriptor, and the rodata cells
