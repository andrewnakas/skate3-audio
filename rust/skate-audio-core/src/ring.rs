//! The decode ring: cutting one block of samples out of it, and writing one block back into it.
//!
//! Four verified bodies that sit directly on top of one another. `sub_82B3DD90` — which is
//! **not** here, see below — builds a 16-byte ring window on its frame and a one- or two-entry
//! segment array, hands both to [`fill_segments`], and then calls [`fill_tail`] to pad whatever
//! the ring could not supply. [`fill_segments`] in turn calls [`copy_from_ring`] once per segment.
//! [`write_into_ring`] is the other direction: the producer side, which places a finished block back
//! into the same wrapping ring.
//!
//! | function | guest | `docs/ports.md` | lifted lines | calls/boot | calls/play |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|---|
//! | [`copy_from_ring`] | `sub_82B3DB90` | verified | 109 | 940,743 | 1,306,629 |
//! | [`fill_segments`] | `sub_82B3DC48` | verified | 184 | 533,208 | 759,184 |
//! | [`fill_tail`] | `sub_82B3DF90` | verified | 242 | 533,208 | 759,184 |
//! | [`write_into_ring`] | `sub_82B3DEA8` | verified | 132 | 266,604 | 379,592 |
//!
//! They share a module because they share a structure and a call edge, not because they do similar
//! things: all four take the same stream object in `r3`, and the object's `+20`/`+24` pair is
//! `copy_from_ring`'s wrap span, `fill_segments`'s `kObjSpanHigh`/`kObjSpanLow`, `fill_tail`'s
//! `kEnd` and `write_into_ring`'s divisor and lag. Porting them apart would have meant naming those
//! cells four times and hoping the four readings agreed. Porting them together makes
//! `fill_segments`'s call to `copy_from_ring` a real call rather than a stub, which is the only part
//! of that body a test can actually drive.
//!
//! **[`copy_from_ring`] and [`write_into_ring`] are twins that do not share one line of code**, and
//! that is deliberate. Both end in two `memcpy`s, one reaching the ring's end and one from its base,
//! and both wrap a cursor by the object's `(high - low)` words. But the read side measures its source
//! *backwards* from a cursor held in the ring descriptor, and the write side computes its cursor
//! *forwards* from a word position held in the object at `+52` through a `divw`. The two derivations
//! share no intermediate, so factoring them would have meant inventing a common form neither
//! original has.
//!
//! **`sub_82B3DD90`, their caller, is deliberately absent.** `docs/ports.md` records it
//! `gate-2`: `sub_82B3DF90`'s store bases are the segment output pointers `sub_82B3DC48` produces
//! *during* the call, so its write set does not derive from entry state and the harness cannot
//! bracket it. There is no verified reference for it in either language.
//!
//! ## What the green here means
//!
//! These are **unit-tested against a verified reference** — the crate README's second kind of
//! green. Each C++ body was compared call-for-call against the original under the shadow harness at
//! zero divergence, on the real inputs the call counts above come from. The Rust has no recorded
//! vectors of its own yet. A fault here is a transcription error rather than a misreading of the
//! engine, which is a much smaller search space; it is not a number.
//!
//! ## Nothing in `docs/rw_audio_structs.h` names any of this
//!
//! Every offset below is the raw offset plus the use the lifted body makes of it. No field name
//! here is recovered from RTTI or from plug-in metadata, and none should be read as one.
//!
//! ## Two things reproduced rather than fixed
//!
//! - [`copy_from_ring`] re-reads the ring base **after** its first copy, so a copy that lands on
//!   the ring descriptor feeds the second copy the changed value. The original does; the C++ note
//!   calls it out; it is kept.
//! - [`fill_tail`] reloads the buffer pointer out of the record before **every** store, and reloads
//!   the object's three control fields between its two fills. A fill that aliased either would
//!   change its own target mid-loop. Kept for the same reason.
//!
//! ## One divergence, in the direction of not hanging
//!
//! A length that runs off the guest map is an `Err` here, where the original would run a ~4 GB
//! `memcpy` or walk a fill loop into unmapped memory. The C++ `Windows()` builders refuse exactly
//! that class of input, so nothing is known about what the guest does with it either — an `Err`
//! resolves an unknown rather than contradicting a known. See [`crate::mem`].
